# Rust Detection Using Convolutional Nueral Network

## Overview
Rusting is a big problem. It can cause big problems if they are not inspected properly. Big buldings or bridges can fall becuase of it, but inspection of every part of building or bridges might need a lot of man power or it might be a tedious work. 

So I created this model to detect if there is any corrosion in the things which are made of iron.

## Prerequisites
1. Numpy 
2. Pandas
3. Tensorflow

## Installing
First make sure you have right version of python
```
python --version
```
```
Python 3.8.1
```
Installing all the libraries
```
pip install numpy
```
```
pip install numpy
```
```
pip install tensorflow
```

### Model
This model is A Convolutional Neural Network with three convolution layers and two dense layers
